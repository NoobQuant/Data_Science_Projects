# List of different causal assumptions used in the literature

 - **Consistency**
   - Formulation (Pearl, 2009, p. 99): $X=x \implies Y(x, u) = Y$ for every $u$. That is, if the actual value of exposure X turned out to be x, then the value of that outcome Y would take (if X were x) is equal to the actual value of Y. 
   - "*Assumption that is violated whenever versions of treatment/exposure have unintended side effects on the outcomes of interest*" (Pearl 2010).
   - "Consistency is generally satisfied if we can describe a well-defined intervention that reflects the way in which the exposure changed in our data" (Caniglia & Murray 2020).
   - See also Cole & Frangakis (2009).

 - **Exchangeability**
   - Loose formulation: "*You can exchange the treated and the untreated for the same result*" ([Data Talks, Exchangability: Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUZA5dTgegQ)).
   "*[We] ought to make sure that any response differences between the treated and the untreated group is due to the treatment itself and not to some intrinsic differences between the groups that are unrelated to the treatment*" (Pearl 2009, p.196).
   - For more formal treatment, see Saarela et al (2020).

 - **Ignorability**
   - TBF

 - **Ignorability, sequantial**
   - Ignorability assumption for longitudinal (panel) data as in Imai & Kim (2019).
   - For each $i=1, 2,\dots, N$, $$\begin{align*}
      \{Y_{it}(1), Y_{it}(0) \}_{t=1}^T & \!\perp\!\!\!\perp X_{1i} \mid U_{i} \\
      \vdots \\
      \{Y_{it}(1), Y_{it}(0) \}_{t=1}^T & \!\perp\!\!\!\perp X_{1t'} \mid U_{i}, X_{i1}, \dots , X_{it'-1} \\
      \vdots \\
      \{Y_{it}(1), Y_{it}(0) \}_{t=1}^T & \!\perp\!\!\!\perp X_{1t} \mid U_{i}, X_{i1}, \dots , X_{iT-1}
    \end{align*}$$

 - **No carryover effect**
   - Assumption that past treatments do not directly affect current outcome. That is, $Y_{it}(X_{i1}, X_{i2}, \dots , X_{it}) = Y_{it}(X_{it})$
   - Used in panel data setting in Imai & Kim (2019).

 - **No spill-over effect**
   - "*The outcome of a unit is not affected by the treatments of other units.*". Seems to be part of SUTVA.
   - Used in panel data setting in Imai & Kim (2019), with reference to Rubin (1990).

 - **Stable unit treatmnet value assumption (SUTVA)**
   - "*The potential outcomes for any unit do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units, and, for each unit, there are no different forms or versions of each treatment level, which lead to different potential outcomes*" (Imbens & Rubin 2015, p. 10).
